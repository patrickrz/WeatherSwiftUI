# WeatherSwiftUI

This is the fourth and final in a series of Mini-Projects completed for Mobile Developers of Berkeley's 6 week training program. This is a weather application that makes API calls to the OpenWeather API. The application also utilizes the CoreLocation framework to identify the user's current location. Additionally, a toggle was also added so that users can easily switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius measurement systems.. The user interface for this project was completed completely in Apple's new SwiftUI language.
