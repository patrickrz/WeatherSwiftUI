This is the fourth and final in a series of Mini-Projects completed for Mobile Developers of Berkeley's 6 week training program. This is a weather application that makes API calls to the OpenWeather API. The application also utilizes the CoreLocation framework to identify the user's current location. The user interface for this project was completed completly in Apple's new SwiftUI language.
